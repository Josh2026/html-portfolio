<h1>The Best Movies According to Joshua</h1>
<h2>My Top 5 Movies of all-time</h2>

<h3>
    The Gray Man
</h3>
<p>
    The movie had alot of great actions but was more 
    than just action. Protecting those you love, sacrificing yourself 
    for others... moments in the movie that really caught my eye.

<h3>
    Inception
</h3>
<p>
    This movie hit all the right spots. Love, action,
    drama. Also, I loved how it challenged my brain to be able to 
    understand what was going on.

<h3>
    The Hunger Games Movie I
</h3>
<p>
    Really great to see lovers make it to the end.
